MAKE RESOURCE UNIQUE
A lot of problems originate from the use of overlapping resource names, either between different tests run done by the same user or
between simoultaneous test runs done by different users. Such problems can be prevented (or repaired) by using unique identifiers for all 
resources that are allocated, for example including a time-stamp. When you include the name of the test responsible for allocating the
resource in this identifier, you will have less problems finding tests that do not properly release their resources.
