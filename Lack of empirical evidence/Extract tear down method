EXTRACT TEAR DOWN METHOD

MOTIVATION:
Avoid the code duplication generated by
finalization routines shared among several test cases. This
kind of code duplication obscures the test case and hinders
maintenance. Removing them from the test code is a standard
solution.

MECHANICS:
- Create a new public method responsible for finalization
routines
- Remove finalization duplicated code from test cases
