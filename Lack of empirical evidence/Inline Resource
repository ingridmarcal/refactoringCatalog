INLINE RESOURCE
[Deursen] To remove the dependency between a test method and some external resource incorporating that resource in the test code.
This is done by setting up a fixture in the test code that holds the same contents as the resource. 
This fixture is then used instead of the resource to run the test. A simple example of this refactoring is putting the contents of
a file that is used into some string in the test code.
