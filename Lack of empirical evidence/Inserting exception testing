JOIN EXCEPTION TESTING
When a new exception handling routine is implemented in production code, developers have to update the test suite to guarantee the correct
behavior in case the new exception occurs. We observed that it is common practice to add the exception testing to the same test case
that verifies the application method. It can be considered a bad testing practice, since exception must be tested in its own test method
